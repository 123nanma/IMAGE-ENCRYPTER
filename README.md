This application allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt images using AES encryption (CBC mode) with a password-based key. Here are some key features of the project:

🔐 AES Encryption: Strong encryption ensures image data is safe from unauthorized access.
💻 User-friendly Interface: Designed with Tkinter for easy interaction, including password entry and file selection.
📸 Image File Support: Supports popular image formats like PNG, JPG, BMP for encryption/decryption.
🔑 Secure Key Generation: A password-based AES key generation mechanism ensures data security.

📂 Functionality:

Encrypt an image: Select an image, input a password, and get an encrypted file.
Decrypt an image: Choose an encrypted file, input the password, and restore the original image.
